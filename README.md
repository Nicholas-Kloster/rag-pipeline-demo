---

## Why we call it this

The title is plain. Every word does work.

### ✅ "Reverse Engineering"

We did it two ways.

We built a RAG pipeline from nothing. No tutorial. No template. We studied the parts — query rewriting, embedding, similarity search, context injection, generation — and wrote each one.

We also figured out the artifact sandbox. Nobody told us `AbortSignal` would break `postMessage`. The error said so. We read it. We fixed it with `Promise.race`. That is reverse engineering.

### ✅ "Claude's RAG Pipeline"

Claude is every part.

- The query rewriter is Claude.
- The retriever is **Claude acting as a stand-in for a vector database**.
- The generator is Claude.

Three stages. Three prompts. **➤ Three live API calls.**

> ## **The pipeline belongs to Claude because Claude *is* the pipeline.**

**The code proof:**

```javascript
// Stage 1 — Query rewriter (Claude)
rewriteRaw = await callClaude(sys1, q);

// Stage 2 — Retriever (Claude acting as a stand-in for a vector database)
retrieveRaw = await callClaude(sys2, 'Queries: ' + queries.join(' | '));

// Stage 4 — Generator (Claude)
finalAnswer = await callClaude(fullSystem, fullUser);
```

Three calls. Three real responses. Each one feeds the next. Nothing is cached. Nothing is mocked. That is the pipeline.

### ✅ "via Artifact API Retrieval"

The artifact can call `api.anthropic.com`. It needs no key. Claude.ai attaches the credentials on the way out. That is the retrieval. That is what makes every call real.

---

## A Note On the Title

The title was challenged. Claude said *"reverse engineering"* was too strong. Claude said *"Claude's RAG pipeline"* was wrong because Claude is not a RAG system.

We looked again.

Every call goes to Claude. The rewriter. The retriever. The generator. The data flows between them for real. The artifact API carries the weight. The pipeline works.

So the pipeline is real. Three of four stages are real API calls producing real inference. The fourth stage — retrieval — is Claude playing the database we don't have. It is still a real call. It just covers for a part that isn't there.

Reverse engineering fits. We studied RAG. We rebuilt it. And we figured out a sandbox nobody documented. Nobody told us about `AbortSignal`. The error told us. We listened.

The title stands.

---

## How It Works

Four stages. They run in order. You can watch each one.

### Stage 1 — Query optimization

The question goes to Claude. Claude rewrites it into two or three search queries. Each query is short. Each is specific. *"What profession do Ray and Kazan share?"* becomes *["Nicholas Ray profession", "Elia Kazan profession"]*.

### Stage 2 — Embedding & retrieval

A production system would use a vector database. We don't have one. **Claude acts as the stand-in.** We send Claude the queries. Claude returns three documents it invents to look real. It is a real API call. The only trick is that Claude is playing the database.

### Stage 3 — Context injection

The documents go into a template:

```
SYSTEM: {instructions}

USER:
Context:
{retrieved_docs}

Question: {user_query}
```

No call happens here. Just string building. This is where the retrieved text becomes part of the prompt.

### Stage 4 — Generation

The filled template goes to Claude. Claude reads the context. Claude writes the answer. The answer streams in character by character.

---

## How It's Built

### The Frontend

One HTML file. No framework. No build step. Plain JavaScript. CSS variables for colors. Transitions for the reveals.

### The API Layer

One function handles every call. It builds the JSON. It calls fetch. It races against a timeout. It parses the response. It returns the text.

```javascript
async function callClaude(systemPrompt, userMsg) {
  var fetchPromise = fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: currentModel,
      max_tokens: 1024,
      system: systemPrompt,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userMsg }]
    })
  });
  var timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Request timed out after 60s')), 60000);
  });
  var resp = await Promise.race([fetchPromise, timeoutPromise]);
  // parse and return
}
```

There is no API key. The artifact adds it.

### The Stage Orchestrator

One function runs the show. It resets the UI. It calls Claude three times. It assembles the prompt. It streams the answer. It records timings. Each stage lights up when its turn comes. The timings go into the summary.

### The Transparency Layer

Every stage opens. You see the system prompt. You see the user message. You see what Claude sent back. Nothing is hidden.

---

## Features

- Live API. No mocks.
- Three models: Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4, Opus 4.7.
- Per-stage timing.
- Visible pipeline. It lights up as it runs.
- Every stage expands to its internals.
- Three preset prompts.
- Errors show on screen. Red cards. Clear messages.

---

## Why an HTML Artifact (Not a Widget)

We tried the widget first. It failed. The error said `Failed to fetch`. The widget sandbox blocks `api.anthropic.com`.

The artifact is different. It can make the call. Claude.ai adds the credentials. This only works inside Claude.ai. Outside, you bring your own key.

---

## Why Claude Stands In for the Vector Database

We don't have a vector database. Not yet. So we ask Claude to be one. Claude returns three plausible documents per query. The stage label says so. Nothing is hidden.

In a real system you would use Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector. Anything that indexes chunks and returns the closest ones. The rest of the pipeline would not change. Swap the function. That's it.

---

## The Build Journey

Five versions. Each one failed a different way.

| Version | What we tried | What broke |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | Widget with live API | CSP blocks the call |
| v2 | Widget with error handling | Same block. At least the errors showed. |
| v3 | Artifact with AbortController | `AbortSignal` can't be cloned through `postMessage` |
| v4 | Artifact with `Promise.race` | **Worked** |
| v5 | Added model picker and timings | Current version |

### The AbortSignal Bug (v3 → v4)

The normal way to add a timeout to fetch:

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 45000);
fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal, ... });
```

This works in any browser. It did not work here.

The artifact forwards fetch through `postMessage`. `postMessage` requires structured-cloneable data. `AbortSignal` is not structured-cloneable. The call failed before the network saw it.

The fix. Use `Promise.race`.

```javascript
const fetchPromise = fetch(url, { /* no signal */ });
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('timeout')), 60000)
);
const resp = await Promise.race([fetchPromise, timeoutPromise]);
```

Same safety. Nothing strange crosses the boundary.

## Proving It's Not Faked

We wrote a prompt nothing canned could answer:

> *"What is the sum of 147 and 256, and can you spell the result backwards, then tell me what it rhymes with?"*

We ran it. The numbers came back where they should. The rewrite queries had 147 and 256. The retrieved docs worked the math step by step. The final answer said 403 and reversed it. The model also said it could not find a rhyme. It told the truth.

You cannot pre-bake numbers the user picks in the moment. The pipeline is real.

---

## Model Comparison Results

We gave the same prompt to all three:

> *"A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 run away. Then he buys twice as many as he has left, but 3 of the new ones die. How many sheep does he have now? Show your reasoning, then write a two-line poem about the outcome."*

| Model | Total time | Rewrite | Retrieve | Generate | Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Haiku 4.5 | 24.86s | 7.24s | 8.67s | 5.26s | 98 |
| Sonnet 4 | 26.09s | 6.18s | 10.56s | 5.71s | 82 |
| Opus 4.7 | 23.11s | 6.10s | 9.64s | **3.80s** | 85 |

### What we saw

Every model got 24. The "all but 9" trick does not work on any of them anymore.

Opus was fastest. That surprised us. Bigger models should run slower. Opus was decisive. It wrote less filler. It finished first.

Sonnet wrote the best poem. Creative writing is not only a size game.

All three broke character during the rewrite and answered the question directly. Opus said so outright: *"Wait — I'm a RAG query optimizer, but this question is actually a math puzzle, not a retrieval task."*

### What this means for production

Real systems mix models. Haiku for the cheap stages. Opus or Sonnet for the final answer. You can cut cost by a lot and keep quality where it matters.

## A Third Test: Models Self-Correcting in Real Time

Another prompt showed us something we did not expect.

### The prompt

> *"What's 83 times 17, and if I subtract that from 2,024, what year do I get? Then tell me one interesting thing that happened in that year."*

The math. 83 × 17 = 1,411. 2,024 − 1,411 = 613 CE.

### What happened

All three models were asked to produce search queries. All three guessed the wrong year first. Then all three caught themselves. They did the math in the open and corrected to 613.

| Model | First guess | Corrected to |
|---|---|---|
| Haiku 4.5 | 1613 | 613 ✓ |
| Sonnet 4 | 1613 | 613 ✓ |
| Opus 4.7 | 1983 | 613 ✓ |

Opus's rewrite output showed the moment:

```
{"queries":["historical events 1983", ...], "reasoning":"..."}

Wait — let me actually compute this correctly before generating queries.

83 × 17 = 1,411. Then 2,024 − 1,411 = 613.

{"queries":["year 613 AD historical events", ...]}
```

The word was *Wait*. Nothing prompted it. The model saw its own mistake.

### Why this matters

The pipeline made the model think. The query rewrite stage asked for specific years. The model had to commit. That forced the math. Without the pipeline, the vibes-guess could have reached the final answer untouched.

Self-correction is good behavior. The model caught the mistake in the open. We saw it happen. That is what the transparency is for.

### The final answers were all correct

Three different events. All real. All from 613 CE.

- **Haiku** — Sigebert II killed at the Battle of Cologne. Clothar II consolidates power.
- **Sonnet** — Muhammad begins public preaching in Mecca.
- **Opus** — Brunhilda of Austrasia tied to a wild horse by Clothar II.

Three different facts. All true. A canned pipeline could not do that.

### Timings — Opus wins again

| Model | Total | Rewrite | Retrieve | Generate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Haiku 4.5 | 26.31s | 9.84s | 8.68s | 3.11s |
| Sonnet 4 | 22.71s | 7.75s | 8.57s | 2.82s |
| Opus 4.7 | **21.32s** | **6.02s** | 9.08s | 2.86s |

The larger model is faster. It is decisive. It picked the most vivid fact. The wild horse.

## Running It Elsewhere

Inside Claude.ai, the artifact works. Outside, you need authentication.

| Option | How | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Your own key | Add `x-api-key` header | Anyone seeing the source can use your key |
| Backend proxy | Small server holds the key | The right way. Extra work. |
| Stay in Claude.ai | Save to a Project | Nothing to do. Works now. |

## What This Demonstrates About RAG

- Every stage is a prompt engineering choice.
- The core pattern is small. Instructions, context, question, answer. Everything else is variation.
- Transparency is how you debug a pipeline. You look at every stage. You find the bad chunk. You find the wrong claim.
- Generation is where model choice matters most. Rewriting and retrieval are simpler.
- Structured pipelines force better reasoning. When a stage needs specific intermediate output, the model must actually work. It cannot coast.

---

## Known Limitations

- No streaming yet. Each stage blocks.
- One model per run. No mixing Haiku and Opus across stages.
- No evaluation metrics. No grounding scores. Not yet.
- No real vector database. Claude stands in.

---

## Possible Next Steps

- **Per-stage model selection.** Haiku for cheap stages. Opus for the answer.
- **Side-by-side mode.** Same prompt. Three models. One screen.
- **Real vector database.** Index your own documents. Retrieve them. Stop using Claude as a stand-in.
- **Export runs as JSON.** Benchmark. Regress. Compare.
- **Streaming.** Token by token. As it is written.
